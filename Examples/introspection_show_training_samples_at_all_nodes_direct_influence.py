##  introspection_show_training_samples_at_all_nodes_direct_influence.py

##  The purpose of this script is to descend down the decision tree and show
##  at each node the training samples that participated directly in the
##  feature tests leading to that node.  We refer to this as the DIRECT
##  propagation of a training sample's influence to that node.

##  However, in light of the comments made elsewhere in this distribution,
##  note that a training sample can affect nodes indirectly through the
##  generalization achieved by the probabilistic modeling of the data.
##  Examples of this are nodes that are descendants of the nodes affected
##  directly by the training sample.

##      Node 0: the samples are: None
##      Node 1: the samples are: ['sample_46', 'sample_58']
##      Node 2: the samples are: ['sample_1', 'sample_4', 'sample_7', ..... ]
##      Node 3: the samples are: []
##      Node 4: the samples are: []

##  Again, in keeping with the explanation in the main module file, the
##  empty list for the samples at a node indicates merely that the node is
##  a consequence of the generalization achieved by the probabilistic
##  modeling of the training data.

The DecisionTree module is a Python implementation for
constructing a decision tree from multidimensional training
data and for using the decision tree thus constructed for
classifying new data.

It is highly recommended that you read the README in the 
'Examples' directory if you wish to become familiar with
this module.

If there are any questions about this module, contact the

This README is specifically for the code in the BoostingExamples subdirectory of the
installation directory.

See the README in the Examples subdirectory of the installation directory for the
main examples for using the DecisionTree module.


(1)   boosting_for_classifying_one_test_sample_1.py

      In order to become familiar with how the DecisionTree module can be used with
      boosting, this should be first example you should become familiar with.

      This example uses boosting to classify a single test sample.



(2)   boosting_for_classifying_one_test_sample_2.py

      The only difference between this script and the previous script is the source
      of the training data.  This script uses a synthetically generated training
      file.  As in the previous script, this script uses boosting to classify a
      single test sample.



(3)   boosting_for_bulk_classification.py*

      If you want to use boosting to classify all of the test samples in a disk file
      in one fell swoop, look carefully at this example.

      An example call for this script:

        boosting_for_bulk_classification.py  training6.csv  test6.csv   out6.csv


      where all of your training data is in the file training6.csv and all the test
      samples in the file test6.csv.  The calculated class labels for the test
      samples are written out to the file out6.csv
